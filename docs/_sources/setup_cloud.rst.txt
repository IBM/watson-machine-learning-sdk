IBM Cloud
=========

Requirements
------------
Starting work with IBM Cloud refer to `Getting started <https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/get-started-wdp.html?audience=wdp>`__ section in main product documentation.

Supported machine learning frameworks
-------------------------------------
For the list of supported machine learning frameworks (models) on IBM Cloud, refer to
`Watson Machine Learning Documentation <https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/pm_service_supported_frameworks.html>`__.

Authentication
--------------
To use Watson Machine learning APIs, create an instance of APIClient with authentication details.

**Note:** Depending on the region of your provisioned service instance, use one of the following as your url:

    * Dallas: `https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com`
    * London: `https://eu-gb.ml.cloud.ibm.com`
    * Frankfurt: `https://eu-de.ml.cloud.ibm.com`
    * Tokyo: `https://jp-tok.ml.cloud.ibm.com`

**Note:** To determine `apikey` go to https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys and generate your apikey.

Example of creating the client using apikey:

.. code-block:: python

   from ibm_watson_machine_learning import APIClient

   wml_credentials = {
                      "url": "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
                      "apikey":"***********"
                     }

   client = APIClient(wml_credentials)




Example of creating the client using token:

.. code-block:: python

   from ibm_watson_machine_learning import APIClient

   wml_credentials = {
                      "url": "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
                      "token":"***********",
                     }

   client = APIClient(wml_credentials)

**Note:** Setting default space/project id is mandatory. For details, refer to ``client.set.default_space()`` API in this document.
